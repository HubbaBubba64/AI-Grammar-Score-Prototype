## Month 1 Goal
- Understand tokenization and how NLP models convert text into embeddings
- Create a basic classifier to distinguish "good" vs "bad" sentences
- Extend to a regression model that outputs a grammar score (1–5)
- Deploy a simple inference API

## Future Plan
The long-term objective is to develop a hybrid, privacy-aware writing 
feedback system for students, researchers, and business professionals.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- FastAPI (planned)
- ONNX Runtime + C++ (future plan)
